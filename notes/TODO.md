- ERRORS

    need to print `kbd-file-name`?

hyi

the difference btw pro and air keyboard is that they replaced the paragraph key and
made the left shift key into one which means that in the end it is the same number of keys.

1. try rebuild kmonad


;; TODO

- capslock layer?
- mouse keys https://github.com/david-janssen/kmonad/issues/150'
- clean MIDI layer
- todo macros layer
- https://kennetchaz.github.io/symmetric-typing/soul.html
    symmetric layout >> suppose to be improvement on colemak.
        soul layout is suppose to be the best one.

;; IDEA: 
;;  on disable layer and tutorials layer
;;  hold down key A and double tap key B to unlock the layer
;;  and go back to base layer
